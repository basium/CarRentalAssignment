# TODO: Add these notes in a tidy way 
- used nitro proxy server to avoid cors probelms.
- Download svg files from figma and optimzed them using Figma's 'Simplify' feature and used SVGO SVGOMG
- Optimized asset sizes
- Jakarta font downloaded from GFonts and added through tailwind config. 
- Use of pinia for loading product grid.
- fovorites will be saved in the local storage. This was done to save time but locked me to what I could use. Ideally this would have been server managed too. 
- Docker can be used.
- Did not have enough time to implement tests.
- Did not use Type script, was unsure if it is requried for this job. 
- Text colors could be done using opacity
- Review was faked
- Search text not sanitized
- Images not optimized
- Tests skipped due to lack of time.
